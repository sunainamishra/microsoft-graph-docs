## April 2021: New and generally available

### Identity and access | Identity and sign-in
- Manage an [authentication policy](/graph/api/resources/authenticationflowspolicy) at a tenant level, to enable or disable [self-service sign-up](/graph/api/resources/selfservicesignupauthenticationflowconfiguration) of external users.
- Administrators can associate user flows with apps that are shared with external users and enable [self-service sign-up](/azure/active-directory/external-identities/self-service-sign-up-overview) on those apps. They can customize a self-service sign-up user flow and create a personalized sign-up experience. Once an application is associated with the user flow, users who go to that application will be able to initiate a sign-up flow that provisions a guest account.
- Configure [user flow attributes](/graph/api/resources/identityuserflowattribute) in your Azure AD tenant allows you to collect information about a user during sign-up. You can collect a built-in set of attributes, or configure custom user flow attributes to collect information from a user that is not built in to the directory. 
- In an [Azure Active Directory user flow](/graph/api/resources/b2xidentityuserflow), you can manage language defaults and [customize the language and strings displayed to users in the user flow](/graph/api/resources/userflowlanguageconfiguration).
- Use an [API connector](/graph/api/resources/identityapiconnector) in user flows for Azure AD self-service sign-up and Azure AD B2C sign-up, to call an API at a specific step to affect the execution of the user flow.

### Teamwork
- Identify the channel by the **channelIdentity** property, if a [chatMessage](/graph/api/resources/chatmessage) is within a [channel](/graph/api/resources/channel).
- Identify the chat by the **chatId** property, if the **[chatMessage](/graph/api/resources/chatmessage)** is in a [chat](/graph/api/resources/chat).
- Use the **messages** relationship to get all the [chatMessage](/graph/api/resources/chatmessage) resources in a [chat](/graph/api/resources/chat).
- Use application permissions to [get](/graph/api/chat-get) the properties of a specified [chat](/graph/api/resources/chat).
- Use application permissions to [get a specified chat member](/graph/api/chat-get-members) or [get all the chat members](/graph/api/chat-list-members) included in a chat. Because data for users as chat members is sensitive, other than obtaining application permissions, please [request additional access](teams-protected-apis.md) to these operations.

### Use the Toolkit
New to the [Microsoft Graph Toolkit](/graph/toolkit/overview)? Try the new [Toolkit learning path](/learn/paths/m365-msgraph-toolkit/?WT.mc_id=m365-19989-cxa), use the Toolkit set of web components and authentication providers to connect a web app to Microsoft Graph, and load data from Microsoft 365.

## April 2021: New in preview only

### Education
- Associate a folder with an [educationAssignment](/graph/api/resources/educationAssignment?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) to  store all the related file resources, through the **resourcesFolderUrl** property.
- Deep link into an [educationAssignment](/graph/api/resources/educationAssignment?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) through the **webUrl** property.

### Identity and access | Governance
Administrators can [get](/graph/api/accessreviewpolicy-get?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) or [update](/graph/api/accessreviewpolicy-update?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) policies at the directory-level to review access, by using the [accessReviewPolicy](/graph/api/resources/accessreviewpolicy?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) resource. For example, administrators can use an access review policy to enable or disable group owners reviewing access on groups that they own.

### Search
[Enable spelling suggestions or corrections](search-concept-speller.md) for a user query. This is useful when a user query contains typing errors, or when the errors render no search results.
